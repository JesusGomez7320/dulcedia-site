Dulce Día Cine — Parallax Hero Package
======================================

What's new:
- Parallax-style hero: the video stays fixed while you scroll past the hero.
- Headline sizing & spacing tuned to mirror Nguyen's proportions (desktop & mobile).
- Newspaper-style serif typography and light editorial layout.

How to add your hero video:
1) Name your clip **hero.mp4** (10–20s, muted, 1080p). Optional: **hero.webm**.
2) Put files at:
   assets/hero.mp4
   assets/hero.webm   (optional)
3) Add a still poster image:
   assets/images/hero-poster.jpg
4) Commit & push → Netlify redeploys.

Mobile note:
- iOS may pause large autoplay videos to save data. Keep the clip short and compressed.
- The poster image appears instantly; the video plays as soon as allowed.
